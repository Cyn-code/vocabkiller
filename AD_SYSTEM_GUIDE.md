# 📺 VocabKiller Ad System Implementation Guide

## 🎯 Overview

Your VocabKiller app now has a sophisticated 15-minute ad prompt system that tracks user activity and shows ads without disrupting the learning experience. This system helps monetize your app while keeping it free for users.

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. **Activity Tracking**
- Tracks real user activity (mouse moves, clicks, scrolls, key presses)
- Only counts active time (pauses when user is inactive for 30+ seconds)
- Runs in background without affecting performance

### 2. **15-Minute Timer**
- After 15 minutes of **active** usage, shows ad prompt
- Timer only counts when user is actively using the app
- Resets after user watches an ad

### 3. **Non-Intrusive UX**
- Users can use the app normally for 15 minutes
- Ad prompt appears as a friendly modal, not a popup
- Clear explanation of why ads are shown
- Option to decline (with consequences)

## 📋 System Components

### 1. **ActivityTracker** (`src/utils/activityTracker.js`)
```javascript
// Key features:
- Tracks mouse, keyboard, scroll, touch events
- Calculates active vs inactive time
- Triggers ad prompt after 15 minutes
- Provides detailed statistics
- Handles timer reset after ad viewing
```

### 2. **AdModal** (`src/components/AdModal.js`)
```javascript
// Features:
- Friendly, educational messaging
- 30-second simulated ad with skip option (after 5s)
- Progress bar and countdown
- Thank you message after completion
- Professional design matching your app
```

### 3. **UsageLimitModal** (`src/components/UsageLimitModal.js`)
```javascript
// Features:
- Shown when users decline ads
- Explains usage limits
- Offers immediate ad watching or waiting
- 5-minute cooldown period
- Educational messaging about supporting the app
```

## 🎮 User Experience Flow

### Normal Usage (First 15 minutes)
1. User visits VocabKiller
2. Activity tracker starts monitoring
3. User learns vocabulary normally
4. Debug info shows time remaining (development only)

### Ad Prompt (After 15 active minutes)
1. Friendly modal appears: "Keep Learning with VocabKiller!"
2. Shows how long they've been learning
3. Explains why ads help keep the app free
4. Two options:
   - **Watch Ad** (30 seconds, can skip after 5s)
   - **Maybe Later** (triggers usage limit)

### After Watching Ad
1. Thank you message
2. Timer resets to 0
3. User gets another 15 minutes of free usage
4. Seamless return to learning

### If User Declines Ad
1. Usage becomes limited
2. Learning functions show "Usage Limit Reached" modal
3. Options:
   - Watch ad to continue immediately
   - Wait 5 minutes for reset
   - Clear explanation of the system

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Integration Points
```javascript
// Added to App.js:
1. Activity tracker initialization
2. Ad modal state management
3. Usage limit checks on learning functions
4. Modal components rendering
```

### Protected Functions
```javascript
// These functions now check usage limits:
- openLearnUnknownWordsSubpage()
- openLearnAllUniqueWords()
- openLearnSentencesWithUniqueWords()
```

### Development Features
```javascript
// Debug panel (development only):
- Shows active time
- Shows time until next ad
- Shows activity status
- Located bottom-left corner
```

## 📊 Customization Options

### Timing Adjustments
```javascript
// In activityTracker.js:
this.adPromptInterval = 15 * 60 * 1000; // 15 minutes
this.inactivityThreshold = 30 * 1000;   // 30 seconds

// In UsageLimitModal.js:
timeUntilReset = 300000 // 5 minutes
```

### Ad Duration
```javascript
// In AdModal.js:
const [countdown, setCountdown] = useState(30);     // 30 second ad
const [skipCountdown, setSkipCountdown] = useState(5); // Skip after 5s
```

### Activity Events
```javascript
// In activityTracker.js - events that count as activity:
const events = [
  'mousedown', 'mousemove', 'keypress', 'scroll', 
  'touchstart', 'click', 'keydown'
];
```
